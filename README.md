# TileGame
A simple project to showcase the power of MVVM and LiveData to handle the state changes in a TileGame. The idea is simple, you have to select a number from 1 to 9 in the first screen. In the second screen you will be provided a tile of 9 grids and you have to guess where the number(you selected in first screen) lie. You will get 3 chances to guess.
